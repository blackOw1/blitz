The game involves attacking your opponent's units. Once your opponent has no units, you win. But, if you have no units, you lose. The number on the card indicates how many units you can attack. Each card represented may have a different color. They are black, yellow, cyan, and purple.

Black: you attack normally.

Yellow: your attack is doubled.

Cyan: you attack. Your opponent cannot attack next turn.

Purple (applies if you are unable to attack this turn): you have a 50% chance of attacking. Otherwise, you must end your turn.
